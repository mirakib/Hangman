# Work on project. Stage 4/8: Help is on the way

# Description

Now our game has become quite hard, and your chances of guessing the word depend on the size of the list. When the list has four words, you only have a 25% chance to guess correctly. So let's show a little mercy to the player and add a hint for them.

# Objectives

   1. As in the previous stage, you should use the following word list: 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'
   2. Once the computer has chosen a word from the list, show its first 3 letters. Hidden letters should be replaced with hyphens ("-").

# Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.

Example 1
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word jav-: > java
You survived!
```
Example 2
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word pyt---: > pythia
You lost!
```
