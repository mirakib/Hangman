# Description
At this stage, you will create a real game, though it will still be quite simple. There will be two possible outcomes. Let's first print a welcome message and then ask the player to guess the word we set for the game. If our player manages to guess the exact word, the game reports "win"; otherwise it will "hang" the player.

# Objectives

   1. Ask the player for a possible word.
   2. Print You survived! if the user guesses the word.
   3. Print You lost! if the user guesses incorrectly.

By the way, python should be the word the player needs to guess to win the game.

# Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not the part of the output.

Example 1
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You survived!
```
Example 2
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > java
You lost!
```
