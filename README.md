# Hangman
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!
